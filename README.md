# flask-simple-service
simple-service used to test some observability features in metrics exporter and otel

This is a simple Flask service that I use to learn how to emit metrics to prometheus, traces and spans to OTEL and logging using graylog (although the latter didn't work as I expected); this project was generated using ChatGPT and my feedback.

The credentials are dummy values, so I don't care if a scrapper collects them, they have no use, but to my local lab
